                    </p>

                    <p>The frist challenge was to aquire all the supplies necessary for this excursion. Now
                        these were
                        difficult things to round up and took roughly 3 months of pre-prepartion to aquire. My
                        recommendation is that once you have applied for the lottery to secure a spot, start
                        looking for
                        a
                        suitable boat. Now this boat needed to be light enough to manage to get on a flat bed
                        truck so
                        so we
                        could sucessfully make the portage from Diablo Lake to Ross Lake. This portage invovles
                        boating
                        to a
                        the designated location and calling on the provided telephone to order the portage
                        serivce.
                        It'll
                        cost you 40$ one way, cash only. </p>

                    <p>Our adventure started at the Diablo Lake boat launch, where the vivid turquoise waters
                        greeted
                        us.
                        The color, a result of glacial silt, was breathtaking, and as we loaded our gear onto
                        the boat,
                        I
                        felt a
                        sense of excitement. We set off, gliding across the calm surface, surrounded by towering
                        peaks
                        and
                        lush
                        forests. The stillness of the water mirrored the beauty of the mountains, making every
                        moment
                        feel
                        magical.

                    <h3>Campsite #1: Buster Brown</h3>
                    <p>
                        After a short but picturesque journey, we arrived at our designated campsite on Diablo
                        Lake. The
                        campground was remote and peaceful, accessible only by boat. We pitched our tent under
                        the towering cedar trees and got ready to cook some food as we were famished.</p>
                    <p>

                    </p>

                    <p> While we waited for our first freeze-dried meal to "cook" in the bag with boiling water
                        from our
                        knock-off jetboil we took a moment to appreciate the view. The sound of gentle waves
                        lapping
                        against the shore was the perfect backdrop to the begging of this spectacular adventure.

                    <h3>The View</h3>



                    <p>The new day we packed out gear and headed out for the second portion of the trip: Ross
                        Lake. We
                        were
                        nevervous as we didn't know what to anticipate with the portage process. It seemed crazy
                        to
                        think
                        there was a random phone next to an unmarked dock that we would need to locate and with
                        good
                        timing
                        as there was an early cutt-off time for the last portage trip and we had slept in that
                        day. Time
                        was
                        of the essence but precision with gear packing was of utmost importance due to the fact
                        that we
                        would need to unload and reload everything on the truck once we got to the portage. We
                        were very
                        silent as we hustled to to make up for the time we'd overselt while still being
                        calculated with
                        our
                        packing.</p>

                        a challenge but nothing that we couldn't handle seeing as how well we had sucessfully

                        each part of the trip thus far.</p>

                    <h3>Campsite #2: Big Bear</h3>

                    <p> When we arrived at Big Bear Campsite it was a rough first night. People without a
                        reservtion had
                        taken liberty of setting up their campsite at the location leaving no room for us to set
                        up.
                        That first evening was rough but I had devised a plan for how we were going to secure
                        ourselves
                        a spot the next day. I had heard the group who was located in the idea camping spot that
                        they
                        were heading out early first thing in the morining. I told my adventure pal that we
                        would only
                        setup the tent with the minimal for the first night and then keep an ear out for when
                        that group
                        left around 4am. It was a stroke of genius and my plan worked perfectly. Finally we had
                        truly
                        ARRIVED. </p>

                    <h3>Exploring on Ross Lake</h3>

                    <p>Diablo Lake and Ross Lake are renowned for their breathtaking natural settings and serene
                        environments. The vivid turquoise color of Diablo Lake, shaped by glacial sediments, and
                        the
                        peaceful forested shores of Ross Lake create a picturesque backdrop for outdoor
                        exploration.

                    <p>We spent our days exploring the vast beauty of the lake and checking
                        out other campsite desinations as we were already anticipating a return adventure for
                        the
                        following
                        sesason.</p>

                    <h3>Go Boldly into the Unknown</h3>
                    <p>Boating through these landscapes was incredibly calming and rejuvenating. The hard work
                        in
                        preparing and getting here is worth it ten-fold for the awe-inspiring experince that
                        awaits you.
                        The journey between the two lakes is as memorable as the destination itself. Don't
                        forget to
                        pause often to turly appreciate the beauty that envelops you.</p>
